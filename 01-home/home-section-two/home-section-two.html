            <p class="home-section-two-paragraph">An often overlooked tip, reusing the heat you've generated from things like cooking in the oven or having a hot shower can increase the overall temperature of your home. After you've finished cooking something, keep the oven door open so that the hot air can circulate around the kitchen and beyond. After a hot shower, keep the bathroom door open so that the heat can travel into the other rooms in your house.</p>
