          <p class="water-hero-paragraph">Saving water saves money especially if you are on a water meter. Installing simple devices such as water-efficient taps and showers will save both water and energy by minimising the use of heated water. Around 18% of energy consumption in UK homes is spent heating water, and about 12% of a typical gas heated home’s heating bill is from the water for showers, baths and the hot water tap. So even if you don’t have a water meter you could still be saving money on your energy bill. Such large financial savings can be particularly vital for households facing water and energy poverty.</p>
