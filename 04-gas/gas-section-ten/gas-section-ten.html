              Though a new boiler can be expensive (usually upwards of £1,000), they are a good investment as a newer model will significantly cut your bills. Heating company Vaillant agrees, stating a 30 per cent reduction in bills for homeowners who invest in one of its energy-efficient boilers.

            <p class="gas-section-ten-paragraph">
              Modern boilers are all condensing boilers and have a large heat exchanger. This means more heat is recovered and cooler gases are sent up the flue, making it more efficient. Put it into numbers, new A-rated boilers (any boiler over a 90 per cent efficiency) can give you 90p or more worth of heat for every £1 you put in.

            <p class="gas-section-ten-paragraph">
              To the contrary, this is 60-80p for every £1 in older models. Replacing your old boiler also has benefits for the environme--nt. This is because a more efficient boiler will use less fuel to heat your house, reducing your carbon footprint.
