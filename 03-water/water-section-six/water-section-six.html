      <!-- <h3 class="water-section-six-collapsible-subtitle">Water Efficiency at Schools</h3> -->
      <p class="water-section-six-collapsible-paragraph">Many local water companies have education centres or teams that conduct water-saving assemblies for schools - to educate and enthuse children and young people on the water cycle and the need for water efficiency. Some local water companies and water retail suppliers to schools will also run a water audit that identifies where and how much water can be saved. These programmes are often free or heavily subsidised, and their impact can be substantial. A Waterwise study found that up to 3.13m³ of water per day can be saved on average per school.</p>
