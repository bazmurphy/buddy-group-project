              A smart thermostat will allow you to operate your heating system remotely via an app on your mobile phone or tablet. Some will save your daily routine and work out the best usage for you, others will alter your settings depending on the weather. Some smart thermostats can also adjust the temperature of your boiler output to make sure it's always operating at optimum efficiency.

              It is recommended to team a smart thermostat with smart thermostatic radiator valves so you can remotely control exactly what rooms in your house are heated. When utilised properly, it's one of the cheapest and most convenient ways to improve energy ratings in your home, cutting heating bills and reducing CO2 emissions.
