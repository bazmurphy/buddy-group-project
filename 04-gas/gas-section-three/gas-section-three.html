              Keep warm air circulating by ensuring large pieces of furniture are away from radiators. Otherwise, you'll have to heat your home for longer. Just by moving your sofa even six inches away from the radiator will allow heat to flow around the room much more effectively.
            </p>
            <p class="gas-section-three-paragraph">
              This can save you up to 10%  on your gas bill. The more space between furniture and radiators the better.
