                A smart thermostat will allow you to operate your heating system 
                remotely via an app on your mobile phone or tablet. Some will save 
                your daily routine and work out the best usage for you, others will 
                alter your settings depending on the weather. Some smart thermostats 
                can also adjust the temperature of your boiler output to make sure 
                it's always operating at optimum efficiency.

                It is recommended to team a smart thermostat with smart thermostatic 
                radiator valves so you can remotely control exactly what rooms in your 
                house are heated. When utilised properly, it's one of the cheapest and 
                most convenient ways to improve energy ratings in your home, cutting 
                heating bills and reducing CO2 emissions.
