              Another way to work out how to lower your gas bill is a yearly service by a Gas Safe Registered engineer. Sticking to the recommended amount for how often your boiler should be serviced will ensure that it's working at maximum capacity. During a service, the engineer will check, clean and replace parts and catch any potential problems before the system breaks down.
            </p>
            <p class="gas-section-eight-paragraph">
              Keeping a system maintained doesn't just help lower a gas bill, it will keep it both safe and working efficiently. An efficient boiler uses less energy to heat a house, which means regular services can help keep energy costs lower.

              Not having your boiler serviced could lead to faults, higher energy bills, and your warranty ending early.
