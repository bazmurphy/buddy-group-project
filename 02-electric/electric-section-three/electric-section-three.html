              When you're not using rooms, turn radiator valves down to between 2.5 and 3 (roughly 18°C). While you are using a room, increase the temperature to a comfortable level by turning the valve up. Turning off radiators completely in rooms you are not using is less energy efficient as this means your boiler has to work harder to increase the temperature again than if kept at a low setting.

              People over 65, children under 5 and those with pre-existing health conditions are more vulnerable to cold temperatures. Make sure you are warm enough and have a minimum indoor temperature of 18°C to ensure you protect your health while maintaining comfort.

              Loft insulation is one of the most straightforward ways to increase insulation in your home. According to Energy Saving Trust, if you don’t have any, adding 270mm thickness could save you £355 a year. If you already have 120mm, increasing this to 270mm could save you £35 a year.
