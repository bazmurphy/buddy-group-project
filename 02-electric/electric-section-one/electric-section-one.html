                Modern washing machines can clean clothes effectively at lower temperatures. Changing from 40°C to 30°C means you could get 3 cycles instead of 2 using the same amount of energy, depending on your washing machine.

                Be sure to wait and accumulate enough laundry so that it fills your washing machine's tub before you run a cycle. In the long term this practice will save electricity and money.

                Using your tumble dryer less could save you £70 a year. While having a dryer is convenient and fast, each load uses a fair amount of energy(and you may already be feeling the pinch on your latest billing statement). On average a family of four does upwards of six loads a week—sometimes more. If you’re looking for ways to save money, one option to consider looking into is hanging your clothes on an airer.
