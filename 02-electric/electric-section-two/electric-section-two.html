      <p class="electric-section-two-part-one-paragraph">
        When boiling the kettle, ensure that you only fill the kettle with the
        amount of water that you need. Boiling a full kettle takes longer and
        therefore uses more electricity adding to the charges on your energy
        bill.
      </p>
      <p class="electric-section-two-part-one-paragraph">
        Don’t overfill pans. Fill them with just enough water to cover the
        contents of the pan. Less water means less energy required to heat up the
        pan.

      <p class="electric-section-two-part-three-paragraph">
      Entertainment appliances such as iPads, TVs or laptops do not usually have
      energy labels but white goods, such as dishwashers, fridges and ovens,
      must display their energy efficiency rating by law. The highest possible
      rating is A+++, the lowest for certain appliances will be F or G, with a
      considerable energy saving difference between them. In many cases,
      appliances such as cookers will all be rated A+ or higher. But older
      appliances are likely to be considerably less energy efficient.
      </p>
      <p class="electric-section-two-part-three-paragraph">
        Slow cookers are an energy-efficient cooking appliance, as well as being
        ideal for those who like to prep their food while they’re out or getting
        on with other things - they use little more energy than a traditional
        light bulb, making them a great, energy-efficient addition to any
        kitchen.
