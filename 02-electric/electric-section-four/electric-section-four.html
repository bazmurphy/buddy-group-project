                Smart plugs are a cleverer version of the timer switches homeowners are used to use to. When a device is plugged into a smart plug socket , the outlet can communicate with the device to learn when it is in use. The outlet can then enter power-saving mode when the device is being used, which helps save energy.For example, if a lamp is plugged into a smart outlet, the outlet can automatically turn off the power to the lamp when the lamp is turned off.
