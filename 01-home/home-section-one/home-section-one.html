            <p class="home-section-one-paragraph">The Energy Saving Trust estimate that you can save around £455 per year by installing solar electricity panels on your roof. These panels capture the sun’s energy and convert it into electricity that you can use in your home. Sunlight is free, so once you’ve paid for the initial installation, you can generate your own renewable electricity and reduce your electricity costs for the year.</p>

          <div class="home-section-one-paragraph-container">
            <p class="home-section-one-paragraph">Having a water meter means you only pay for the water you use. This could mean significant savings for your household if you live alone, are a couple or a small family. It also depends on the value of your home. If you decide to get a water meter, did you kow that you can have it installed for free if you live in England and Wales. Fortunately, you can switch  back once you make the request within a year.</p>

            <p class="home-section-one-paragraph">A light jumper adds around 3°C of warmth and a thicker one adds around 4°C. The best way to prevent yourself from needlessly adjusting your thermostat is to ensure you’re dressing appropriately during the winter. While it may sound obvious, by investing in a good pair of merino wool socks, a heavy seater, or a fleece bathrobe, you may save yourself a great deal of money on your gas bill per year.</p>
