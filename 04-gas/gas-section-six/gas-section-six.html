                Good insulation is key to making your home more energy efficient. If you can maximise the thermal performance of your roof, walls, floor, windows and doors, that will give you the best possible foundation for becoming a low-energy household.

              <p class="gas-section-six-paragraph">
                When it comes to insulating your house, your roof should be the first place you look to. A roof can be responsible for more than 35 per cent of home heat loss. Roof insulation is the cheapest and quickest way to stop heat escaping.

              <p class="gas-section-six-paragraph">
                Around a third of the heat in an insulated home is lost through the walls according to the <a class="gas-link" href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/" target="_blank">Energy Saving Trust</a>. Most homes in the UK have either solid walls that can be insulated from the inside or outside, or cavity walls, which have a gap that can be filled with insulation.

              <p class="gas-section-six-paragraph">
                Floor insulation can lower your gas bill. For newer homes, it will most likely have solid concrete floors, onto which you can add a layer of rigid insulation, whereas older homes with suspended timber floors can be insulated by fitting a layer of mineral wool under the floorboards.

                Use draught excluder tape for a quick fix. It helps stop draughts coming in through windows and gaps between doors, and throwing down an extra rug or two will also help chilly rooms.
