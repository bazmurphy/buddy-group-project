            <p class="home-section-four-paragraph">An often overlooked tip, reusing the heat you've generated from things like cooking in the oven or having a hot shower can increase the overall temperature of your home. After you've finished cooking something, keep the oven door open so that the hot air can circulate around the kitchen and beyond. After a hot shower, keep the bathroom door open so that the heat can travel into the other rooms in your house.</p>

            <p class="home-section-four-paragraph">The good news is, all you really need to begin with is a pen and a pad; you can start by taking a walk around the house and producing a checklist from room to room, making a note of any problematic areas. Begin by locating draughts, scoping out insulation levels and checking ventilation.</p>
