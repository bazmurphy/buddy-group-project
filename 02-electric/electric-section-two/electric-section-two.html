                When boiling the kettle, ensure that you only fill the kettle with the amount of water that you need. Boiling a full kettle takes longer and therefore uses more electricity adding to the charges on your energy bill.

              <p class="electric-section-two-subsection-one-paragraph">
                Don’t overfill pans. Fill them with just enough water to cover the contents of the pan. Less water means less gas required to heat up the pan.

                    Entertainment appliances such as iPads, TVs or laptops do not usually have energy labels but white goods, such as dishwashers, fridges and ovens, must display their energy efficiency rating by law.
                  </p>
                  <p class="electric-section-two-subsection-three-paragraph">
                    The highest possible rating is A+++, the lowest for certain appliances will be F or G, with a considerable energy saving difference between them. In many cases, appliances such as cookers will all be rated A+ or higher. But older appliances are likely to be considerably less energy efficient. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="electric-section-two-subsection-three-paragraph">
                    Slow cookers are an energy-efficient cooking appliance, as well as being ideal for those who like to prep their food while they’re out or getting on with other things - they use little more energy than a traditional light bulb, making them a great, energy-efficient addition to any kitchen.
