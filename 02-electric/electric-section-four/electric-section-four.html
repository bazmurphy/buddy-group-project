              Smart meters allow you to see exactly how much energy you are using and when, helping your household make changes to your energy consumption habits, like turning off lights when you leave a room or switching items off at the plug instead of leaving them on standby. You can also see how your energy use changes over time, so you know whether the alterations to daily habits are making a difference.

            <p class="electric-section-four-subsection-one-paragraph">
              Contact your energy supplier about installing a smart meter as you may be able to request one from them for free.

                  When a device is plugged into a smart plug socket, the outlet can communicate with the device to learn when it is in use. The outlet can then enter power-saving mode when the device is being used, which helps save energy.For example, if a lamp is plugged into a smart outlet, the outlet can automatically turn off the power to the lamp when the lamp is turned off.
